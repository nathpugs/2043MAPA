          <p>So Feminists.</p>

<p>Reading that word will generally make you feel one of these things: Pride and determination, Anger and annoyance Or just a shrug and maybe eyeroll. It is a movement which has divided people and created an online frenzy of videos, websites, social media movements and pages, articles and people voicing their opinion.</p>

<p>People will link the hashtag movement “#Metoo” to feminism, “#Everydaysexism” is another one liked to feminism. The gender wage gap is a topic linked to feminism. And looking through social media, news and articles you will find headstrong feminists and anti feminists arguing over and over on different topics.</p>

<p>But as a decent human most of us agree, males and females should be treated fairly and not be discriminated on gender. So why are people arguing when they agree on the same point? The definition of feminism is “the advocacy of women's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes.”! So why has it become such a taboo topic?</p>

<p>“Femi-nazis” is the offencive slang term for feminist’s some are also accused of being “Man-haters”. The stereotype comes from self proclaimed “feminists” who are very defensive towards themselves and do not want to help or acknowledge male issues and exgaterate the female issues.</p>

<p>The issue is rather than highlighting on issues and wanting to make the sexes equal feminists and non feminists are too busy arguing over pointless things. When they should be focusing on things such as males not having as long paternity leave, females being sexually harassed in the workplace, Or people being judged and stereotyped for “gendered” jobs.  
The movement is based on real issues but a few people with loud opinions take it way too far and out of control. Rather than wanting equal rights they make it become a female only movement which wants females to have more rights than males. And then people wrongly assume this is the real feminist movement. And think all feminists are hot headed  and have invaluable opinions.</p>

<p>So what can you, a simple internet browsing specimen do? Firstly do not get involved in the arguments. People with strong opinions tend not to listen to people arguing with them. Instead open up your mind to both sides. Try to see the real issues and bring focus to the real issues. Whether you call yourself a feminist or not they are based on important issues which could do with sharing! Below are some links to meaningful issues around this topic (not just a meaningless rant about why it’s unfair on average males get paid more… although it is based regardless of job or position and is purely a wide scale bases!) </p>

<p>-Stay Outrageous</p>
