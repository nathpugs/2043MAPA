<p>Sexism, can make for some pretty funny jokes. Before you get hurt hear us out! Some of the best jokes are offensive and distasteful. But thats all they are a joke. A casual women in kitchen joke can be funny among friends. But what if you, a highly educated, hard working women (If you're not pretend for a second) got told by your male boss to go make food. While your male co-workers of the same job got to do real work. Then it’s not so funny. Bit more personal.</p>

<p>Luckily womens and mens rights are a lot closer than they were. It’s unlikely that senorio will happen and if it did there are now laws in place to help protect women. So while it can be a funny joke. What is real sexism?</p>

<p>Hold onto your hats while we make some groundbreaking statements. Females on average are better with children and reading emotions. On average males are physically stronger and better at decision making. Yes annoying. We are not saying Guy’s can’t be compassionate or loving or girl’s cannot be leaders or strong. But this is average. We are not personally attacking people this is just what is average.</p> 

<p>So once we get over the fact males and females are different and tend to be better at different things. That’s life. There is expectations absolutely, which is great. But on average this is how it is. Which is not a bad thing! If everyone was completely equal life would be boring. It’s nice people have different qualities and this differs per person. But on average this is a trend we tend to see.</p>

<p>he thing is we cannot pretend that these trends are not real. Because they are. The best we can do is acknowledge them and realise that’s average but there are always exceptions and that’s great! So while most primary school teachers are nursery careers are women, it’s normal and great to see males working at the same job. Same with politics and building, mainly male orientated but great to see females working there.</p>

<p>So if the world would stop fighting over pointless males vs females for a second and realise stereotypes are based on qualities that trend based on the sex but are not firm that would be great. And let’s look at the real issues.</p>

<p>Women are harassed, males are not taken seriously with emotion, both are pushed into their labeled stereotype boxes which cause a lot of mental harm.</p>

<p>If we stop pushing people into labels before we know them it will do a lot of good for the world. There are so so many examples and point’s it’s a bit of a rabbit hole to be honest. But the moral is stop pushing stereotypes and expectations on people based on their sex. When you meet “female person” you should think aha they are female. Maybe you will think they must be good with children! Maybe they are. Maybe they are not. You cannot assume anything based on that. You may be a little surprised when she says she is a builder. Which is fine, it’s a male dominated profession. Suprise is fine. But for the love of everything good. Don’t say anything like “oh must be a hard job for a women!” that is when it gets bad. Every person is different and sex does not define that!</p>

<p>Same with is you meet “Male person” and he says he is a builder. You may think aha he is strong and suited for the job. But what if he is quitting in 2 months to be a stay at home dad? Does that make him less of a man? Well how is that even possible?! What will the children do without their mother! Nope. Just shhh. Everyone is different and it’s this underlying sexism which causes future problems.</p>

<p>Males find it hard to report sexual assault and domestic abuse. Females find it hard to be taken seriously at work. Just by rethinking and challenging others over how they think you could help get rid of sexism. Letting everyone know they can be strong and independent, show emotions, cry, look after themselves and others. It can help people become more decent humans and stop treating people differently based off sex.</p>

<p>-Stay Outrageous</p>
