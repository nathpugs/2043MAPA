              <p>At Outrageous we are planning to push boundaries and create outrageous content which is shock and surprise viewers. The point our project is not to offend but to highlight how Outrageous and ridiculous some views and movements are. Most of the time these are based on real issues, but the extent they go to is not needed and in some ways do more harm than good. We aim to make people think about their actions and be kinder towards one another without having to fight to get your opinion across. </p>

            <p>We challenge opinions, and aim to challenge you into thinking deeper into real issues and meanings behind things.</p>
            
            <p>Stay Outrageous!</p>
